# Phone Book 2011
It is one of my earliest desktop applications I created in my early life when I started to learning coding!

# Features:
o	Contact Storage: The core functionality of the program was the ability to store and organize contacts. Users could input a contact's name, phone number, email address, and additional notes. These details were then saved in files with a special extension.
o	User-Friendly Interface: I paid special attention to the user interface. The program featured a simple, intuitive design with graphical buttons and text fields, making it accessible to users of all ages.
o	Add/Edit/Delete Contacts: Users could add new contacts, edit existing ones, and delete contacts they no longer needed.
o	Customization: The program enabled users to customize the appearance to some extent, such as changing the background color or choosing.
